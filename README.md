# Simple Linear Regression in R

## Overview

This project demonstrates a basic linear regression analysis in **R**, using hematological data from 20 patients. The goal is to predict **hemoglobin levels (HB)** from variables such as **hematocrit (HT)**, **MCH**, and **MCV**.

While this dataset is medical, the approach applies broadly to **any field**  including **marketing, business analytics, economics**, or **social sciences**  wherever relationships between variables need to be quantified.

This was created as part of coursework in the MSc in Applied Statistics (AUEB).

## What It Shows

- Fitting simple and multiple regression models using `lm()`
- Interpreting coefficients and model significance
- Comparing models using **Adjusted R²** and **AIC**
- Theoretical elements applied:
  - Linear model: `Y = β₀ + β₁X₁ + ... + βₚXₚ + ε`
  - Model selection with `step()`
  - Confidence intervals and residual diagnostics

## Summary

A concise, reproducible example of **linear regression modeling** in R — illustrating its power as a general-purpose statistical tool, useful in many disciplines beyond healthcare.
